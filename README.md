# Interactive-JavaScript-Shell-Prototype
We have implemented an offline-enabled Interactive JavaScript Shell where a user can write any HTML, CSS and JavaScript code and see its output instantaneously.

To run this, download all the files in a same folder and open the HTML file in browser. After this you are good to go!
